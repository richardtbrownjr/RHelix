# RHelix - A Modern Language for the AI Era

> ðŸŽ“ A learning project to deeply understand programming language design while building something practical for the age of AI-assisted development. I'm building this language as a journey to understand how programming languages really work under the hood. But rather than just building another toy language, I want to create something that addresses a real need: **a language designed from the ground up for the era of AI pair programming**.

### The Learning Goals
- **Understand memory management** by implementing multiple strategies (GC, manual, hybrid)
- **Master parsing and compilation** by building a full compiler pipeline
- **Learn optimization techniques** by making Python-like code run at C++ speeds
- **Explore type systems** by implementing gradual typing with inference

### The Practical Vision
As AI tools become our coding partners, we need languages that:
- Are **readable** enough for AI to understand and generate correctly
- Have **explicit performance controls** that AI can reason about
- Support **gradual refinement** from prototype to production
- Provide **clear error messages** that help both humans and AI debug

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **AI-Friendly Syntax**
```python
# Clear, Python-like syntax that AI models understand well
def process_data(data: List[float]) -> Statistics:
    return calculate_stats(data)

# But with performance hints AI can use
@performance_critical
@arena(size="100MB")  # AI knows this needs memory optimization
def process_large_dataset(data: Dataset) -> Results:
    # Explicit performance intentions
    parallel for batch in data.batches():
        process_batch(batch)
```

### 2. **Progressive Performance**
Start simple, optimize only where needed:
```python
# Version 1: Simple, let AI generate this
def blur_image(img: Image) -> Image:
    return apply_gaussian_blur(img)

# Version 2: AI helps optimize hot paths
@optimize
def blur_image(img: Image) -> Image:
    with arena("10MB"):  # AI suggested this after profiling
        # Optimized implementation
```

### 3. **Memory Management That Makes Sense**
- **Default**: Automatic (like Python) - AI doesn't need to worry about it
- **Explicit**: When you need control - AI can see the intent clearly
```python
# Automatic (default)
data = load_file("big.csv")

# Explicit when needed
with stack[4096]:  # Clear to both human and AI
    temp_buffer = process_chunk(data)
```

## Current Status - under construction

### Implemented
- [x] Core memory management system in C
  - Reference counting with cycle detection
  - Arena allocators for bulk operations
  - Stack allocation for temporaries
- [x] Language design for memory annotations
- [x] Basic compiler structure for memory features

### In Progress
- [ ] Parser for the language syntax
- [ ] Type system with gradual typing
- [ ] Code generation to C

### Planned
- [ ] JIT compilation for hot paths
- [ ] AI-friendly error messages
- [ ] Built-in profiling annotations
- [ ] Standard library with AI use cases in mind

## Example: Real-World Image Processing

Here's how the language handles a practical task with progressive optimization:

```python
# Simple version - AI can generate this easily
def process_images(images: List[Image]) -> List[Image]:
    return [enhance(img) for img in images]

# Performance version - AI can optimize when needed
@parallel
def process_images(images: List[Image]) -> List[Image]:
    # AI knows to suggest arena for batch processing
    @arena(size="100MB")
    def process_batch(batch: List[Image]) -> List[Image]:
        results = []
        for img in batch:
            # Stack allocation for temporaries
            with stack[img.size * 4]:
                enhanced = enhance_fast(img)
                results.append(enhanced)
        return results
    
    # Process in parallel batches
    return parallel_map(process_batch, images.chunks(cpu_count()))
```

## Learning Journey & Blog Posts

I'm documenting what I learn along the way:

## Try It Out (Eventually!)

```bash
# Clone the repo 
git clone https://github.com/richardtbrownjr/RHelix
cd rhelix

# Build the runtime (C components)
make runtime

# Run tests
make test

# Try examples (coming soon)
./rhelix examples/hello.rx
```

## Contributing

This is a learning project, but I'd love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to:
- **Open issues** with suggestions or questions
- **Share resources** about language design
- **Discuss design decisions** in the discussions tab
- **Contribute code** if you're also learning!

## Design Philosophy for AI Era

### What AI Needs from a Language
1. **Clear intent** - Performance annotations make optimization goals explicit
2. **Gradual complexity** - Simple code stays simple, complex only when needed
3. **Error clarity** - Errors that explain *why* not just *what*
4. **Profiling built-in** - AI can see performance data directly

### Example: AI-Assisted Optimization
```python
@profile  # AI can see performance data
def slow_function(data):
    # AI sees this takes 80% of runtime
    result = expensive_operation(data)
    return result

# AI suggests:
@memoize  # Cache results
@parallelize  # Use multiple cores
def optimized_function(data):
    with arena("50MB"):  # Bulk memory allocation
        result = expensive_operation(data)
    return result
```
